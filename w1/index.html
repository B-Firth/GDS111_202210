    <p> Greetings, reader, my name is Branden Firth. I was born here in Rhode Island and live in the town of West Warwick. I am here at New England Tech to follow the Game Design bachelor's program. I am an avid gamer, and I am going to try out of the NEIT eSports team. I mainly play FPS and a few RPGs. Two genre I'm slowly getting into the rougelikes and the Souls-like. Gaming wise I play on a variety of platforms from PC, Playstation, Xbox, and the Nintendio Switch.       
    </p>

    <br>
    <p> With gaming I am more on the casual side, however, I do not mind having some compition every once and a while. Hence the joining of the eSports team. Besides videogames, I am trying to get into Table Top RPGs the prime on being Dungeons and Dragons. I have seen a plethora of people play it from <b>Heros and Halfits</b> (Rooster Teeth) and <strong>Critical Roll</strong> (Geek & Sundry). Granted they are big companies putting on a show, I still want to play the game reguardless. And do not expect my first, or really any, to be exactly like these two stream/shows have them. </p>
