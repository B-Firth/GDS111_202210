            <p> Greetings, reader, my name is Branden Firth. I was born here in Rhode Island and live in the town of West Warwick. I am here at New England Tech to follow the Game Design bachelor's program. I am an avid gamer, and I am going to try out of the NEIT eSports team. I mainly play FPS and a few RPGs. Two genre I'm slowly getting into the rougelikes and the Souls-like. Gaming wise I play on a variety of platforms from PC, Playstation, Xbox, and the Nintendio Switch. With gaming I am more on the casual side, however, I do not mind having some compition every once and a while. Hence the joining of the eSports team. Besides videogames, I am trying to get into Table Top RPGs the prime on being Dungeons and Dragons. I have seen a plethora of people play it from <a href="https://roosterteeth.fandom.com/wiki/Heroes_%26_Halfwits">Heros and Halfits</a> (Rooster Teeth) and <a href="https://critrole.com/">Critical Roll </a> (Geek & Sundry). Granted they are big companies putting on a show, I still want to play the game reguardless. And do not expect my first, or really any, to be exactly like these two stream/shows have them. </p>

            <br>

            <p>For my mains hobbies I like to play video games; my top three being Titanfall 2, T.E.S. V: Skyrim, and  Halo 3. Another hobby of mine is to draw. I mainly do sketch art where I only use the pencil to draw and shade the drawing. I am not really a painter or add much color to my art. But I have been starting to add color to my drawings in photoshop.</p>
